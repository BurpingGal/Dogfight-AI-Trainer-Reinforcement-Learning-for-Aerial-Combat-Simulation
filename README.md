# Dogfight-AI-Trainer-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Aerial-Combat-Simulation

An open-source framework for training AI agents in realistic dogfight scenarios using reinforcement learning, JSBSim flight dynamics, and Azure Machine Learning integration.

### Overview
Most defense AI today is incremental: faster data pipelines, slightly better classifiers, more automation of routine tasks. This project is not incremental. Itâ€™s a foundational step toward autonomous tactical reasoningâ€”starting with the hardest problem in air combat: the dogfight. This is where split-second decisions, energy management, and spatial intuition separate winners from losers. Weâ€™re not simulating bureaucracy. Weâ€™re simulating survival.

Dogfighting is the ultimate adversarial environmentâ€”low latency, high stakes, and no room for error. Yet pilot training remains expensive, logistically constrained, and limited by human availability. Current simulators use scripted AI or canned maneuvers that pilots quickly learn to exploit. Thatâ€™s not training. Thatâ€™s theater. This system replaces brittle rules with adaptive intelligenceâ€”reinforcement learning agents that evolve, surprise, and push human pilots beyond their limits. 

Built on JSBSim for real aerodynamics and integrated with Azure Machine Learning for scalable training, it turns thousands of simulated engagements into tactical knowledge. If you want to understand how AI will dominate future warfare, start here: where machines learn to fight, not just follow orders.

 ### Installation & Setup
 git clone https://github.com/BurpingGal/Dogfight-AI-Trainer-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Aerial-Combat-Simulation/tree/main
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
python
import gym
import dogfight_env

env = gym.make('Dogfight-v0')
obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        break

### Roadmap
âœ…4v4 swarm tactics training
âœ…Azure OpenAI integration for tactical reasoning
âœ…Real-time visualization dashboard
âœ…ONNX model export for edge deployment
